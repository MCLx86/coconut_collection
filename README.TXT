Coconut Collection - 12/22/2021 Beta2

A game heavily inspired by "Coconut Hut" for the Ouya, it's a competetive 2-player game where you collect coconuts and sell them in order to gain cash.

How to play:
mine coconuts w/ your pickaxe, you can click with coconuts on payphones to sell them and get a better pickaxe, you have to take the handset off
the hook first by left clicking.



Prices:
8 coconuts = steel pickaxe
20 coconuts = pickaxe tier2
99 coconuts = coconut drill
