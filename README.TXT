MOVED TO CUBESOFT GIT: http://git.cubesoftware.xyz:20524/MIGDYN/coconut_collection

I'm going to be honest with you - this game is dogshit and I think you should go play Juanchi Game instead.

Coconut Collection - Version 1.0.1

A game heavily inspired by "Coconut Hut" for the Ouya, it's a competetive 2-player game where you collect coconuts and sell them in order to gain cash.

How to play:
mine coconuts w/ your pickaxe, you can click with coconuts on payphones to sell them and get a better pickaxe, you have to take the handset off
the hook first by left clicking.



Prices:
you start out with a hatchet
8 coconuts = steel pickaxe
20 coconuts = 2nd tier pickaxe
99 coconuts = coconut drill





Licenses: mixed (MIT and GPL 2.0)
